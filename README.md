# literature_quiz
This is the very first project I wrote when I began learning python.  

I was taking an English Literature class which its mid-term requires us to match a given text with its author and the title of the poem. So, I wrote a small program to test myself.  

Note that I did not know how to read files into colab at the time (and of course, now I do), so I copy-paste all of the contents into strings. I could revise it now that I've learnt more, but I find it cute to keep it the original way.
